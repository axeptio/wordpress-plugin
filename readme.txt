The 2.0 version of the Axeptio WordPress Plugin brings significant improvements and new features to help you manage cookies on your website more effectively. Here is a detailed list of changes in this new version:

1. **New Interface for Extension Management:** The plugin now comes with a new interface that allows you to manage installed extensions and precisely define the blocking of certain functionalities that might use cookies. This can be done through WordPress hooks and shortcodes.
2. **Introduction of Cookie Analysis Algorithm:** The plugin now provides an algorithm that analyses the likelihood of an extension having third-party cookies. This gives you a better understanding of potential privacy issues related to each extension.
3. **Access to Axeptio Recommended Configurations:** The plugin now allows you to access configurations recommended by Axeptio. Currently, there are about 15, but this will be expanded in the future.
4. **Shortcode Placeholder for Blocked Content:** We've added a placeholder for shortcodes to indicate when content is blocked. Users can unblock the content by accepting the cookie through a button, which opens the Axeptio widget to permit or deny the display of content.
5. **Refactoring of Main Extension Configuration Management:** We've refactored the way we handle the main configuration of the extension, making it more robust and easier to manage.
6. **Additional Language Support:** The plugin is now available in four more languages: German, Spanish, Italian, and Dutch. This will help in reaching a wider audience and serving users in their native languages.

In addition to these features, we have also fixed an issue related to the management of the Axeptio configuration version. Now, the plugin correctly manages different versions of the Axeptio configuration.

As always, we look forward to your feedback and appreciate your continued support for the Axeptio WordPress Plugin.
